# Changelog

## 0.10.54 — 2026-11-13

### Added

- Optional automatic Guild Raid when World Energy naturally rises from below to exactly a configurable threshold.
- Reuse the Raid dialog's team, boss level, count, troop limit and rally settings; keep monitoring while the popup is closed.
- Skip startup/reload, item gains, offline catch-up, energy above the threshold and conflicting queues; report skipped triggers in the dialog.

### Fixed

- Automatically search and continue when a selected boss is missing or the cached search is older than five minutes.
- Search again after target-not-found/expired boss rejections, preserving remaining raid count and excluding failed targets.
- Keep Raid preferences account-bound and respect global RPC settings when saving or starting raids.

## 0.10.53 — 2026-11-13

### Added

- Search Brigand camps from the server, filter levels 1–3 and select a target directly.
- Show camp defenders and the next respawn time; remove defeated and expired targets.
- Support camp discovery through the shared Direct and Piggyback RPC settings.

### Fixed

- Mark Tower complete on Dashboard after a confirmed final boss victory, including responses without optional completion fields (`086fb77`).
- Recognize cached boss victories while respecting daily reset and newer Tower runs.

### Build

- Synchronize package, lockfile and extension manifest versions for each committed release build.
- Keep the prepared version when repeating verification builds before the same commit.

Validation: 618 tests, 606 passed, 12 optional private-data skips; typecheck and production build passed.
