# Changelog

## 0.10.53 — 2026-11-13

### Added

- Search Brigand camps from the server, filter levels 1–3 and select a target directly.
- Show camp defenders and the next respawn time; remove defeated and expired targets.
- Support camp discovery through the shared Direct and Piggyback RPC settings.

### Fixed

- Mark Tower complete on Dashboard after a confirmed final boss victory, including responses without optional completion fields (`086fb77`).
- Recognize cached boss victories while respecting daily reset and newer Tower runs.

### Build

- Synchronize package, lockfile and extension manifest versions for each committed release build.
- Keep the prepared version when repeating verification builds before the same commit.

Validation: 618 tests, 606 passed, 12 optional private-data skips; typecheck and production build passed.
